# Next.js 16 frontend — standalone production image for Cloud Run (us-east4).
# Build context is apps/miyagisanchez (this directory), NOT the monorepo root:
#   docker build -t <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/miyagi-web/frontend:latest apps/miyagisanchez
#
# `output: 'standalone'` (next.config.ts) traces the deps each route actually
# needs into .next/standalone/node_modules. That trace does NOT reliably
# include `sharp` — Next's internal image optimizer requires it dynamically at
# runtime rather than via a static import, so static analysis misses most of
# its native binary + JS lib (confirmed by inspecting the traced output: only
# stub package.json files survived, not sharp/lib or the @img/sharp-<platform>
# binaries) — hence the explicit reinstall in the runner stage below, matching
# Next's own self-hosting Dockerfile guidance and this stage's own glibc/amd64
# platform.
#
# public/ and .next/static are NOT part of the standalone trace (Next only
# traces server-side code) — both are copied explicitly per Next's own
# self-hosting docs.

# caret-pinned in package.json, but npm ci pins to exactly what's in the
# lockfile — a rebuild of the same commit always gets the same tree).

# Next.js inlines NEXT_PUBLIC_* into the CLIENT bundle at `next build` time
# below, so they MUST be in process.env here — Cloud Run runtime
# `--set-env-vars` (infra/gcp/deploy-frontend.sh) is too late for any
# 'use client' read. These are all publishable/anon/public keys, public by
# design. Values arrive as --build-args from cloudbuild.yaml (Secret Manager
# for the real keys, substitutions for the literal-default routing vars).
# Builder stage only — the runner stage already gets real values at runtime.
# `lib/listings.ts` is server-rendered during `next build`; give that server
# read the same public store URL so the initial Cloud Run revision pre-renders
# the catalog instead of falling back to localhost and caching an empty home.
# Keep this list in parity with deploy-frontend.sh's NEXT_PUBLIC_*
# --set-env-vars: guarded by infra/gcp/test/frontend-build-args.test.js.

# Reinstall sharp fresh in THIS stage — the standalone trace above copied only
# stub files for it (see comment at top).
#
# The `rm -rf` is LOAD-BEARING, not tidiness. The standalone output also ships
# node_modules/.package-lock.json — npm's record of what is ALREADY on disk — and it
# lists @img/sharp-libvips-linux-x64 as installed AND `optional`. npm believes that
# inventory over the filesystem, so a bare `npm install sharp` re-extracts NOTHING and
# exits 0 while lib/libvips-cpp.so.<v> is still absent. sharp then throws
# ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED at module load and every /api/img request 500s — i.e. every product
# image on the site. That shipped: 8 days of dead images from 2026-08-25 (rev 00139),
# the image build green the whole time. npm 10 (Node 22) happened to repair the stub
# tree; npm 11 (Node 24) does not, so the Node bump alone surfaced it.
#
# PINNED to the lockfile's own resolution, not a bare `sharp`: `npm install sharp`
# re-resolves to the registry's LATEST at build time, ignoring package.json's range and
# the lockfile both, so the runner could ship a different sharp than the builder
# compiled against. Reading the pin from package-lock.json keeps the two stages in step
# with no second place to update.
#
# The `node -e "require('sharp')"` is the gate: it forces the layer to FAIL here if the
# native library cannot actually load, instead of shipping a green image whose image
# route is dead. An install that exits 0 having restored nothing is exactly the failure
# above, and only loading it proves otherwise.
# Runs as root (before the USER switch below), so re-chown the tree it touched.
