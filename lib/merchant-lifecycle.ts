 *   - CONSUMER: `classifyEnvelope()` turns a verified webhook body into a decision.
 *   - PRODUCER: `buildLifecycleTrackPayload()` builds the POST /api/v1/track body.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ZERO-IMPORT — no `next`, no `server-only`, no Supabase. Every branch
 * below is reachable from a Playwright `api` spec by calling the function directly.
 * An HTTP-level spec can only walk the branches a well-formed request happens to
 * reach, which is how a signature-shaped feature ships four specs that pass
 * identically against a deliberately re-broken build (Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md).
 *
 * The contract this implements is golden-beans'
 * `Roadmap/01-growth-engine/event-destination-router/miyagi-lifecycle-contract.md`.
 * Read it before changing anything here.

 * them — `permission_granted`, `claimed`, `three_products_live`,

 * `shared_externally`, `first_inquiry`). `merchant.preview_approved` is
 * appended last on purpose — it is a PREVIEW fact, not one of the 13 stages
 * (it keeps its own `preview_approved_at` projection column, unchanged by
 * this sprint), so it stays visually distinct from the stage block above it
 * rather than interleaved into `STAGES` order where it doesn't belong.
 *
 * Order here is NOT significant to any consumer (`LIFECYCLE_SET` is a Set;
 * every iteration over this array elsewhere is order-independent) — it is
