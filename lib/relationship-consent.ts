/**
 * lib/relationship-consent.ts
 *
 * Founding merchant activation operations · Sprint 1 (Story 1.3) — the pure
 * consent-evidence rule for `POST /api/promoter/relationship/[id]/consent`.
 * Zero-import, same convention as `lib/merchant-identity.ts`, so the `api`
 * spec can walk every branch without a database.
 *
 * CORRECTED CONTRACT (S1 cross-review A1 — the original build contract's own
 * defect, not a builder mistake): consent must be decided from the same
 * source every other consent surface uses — `readApprovalState` in
 * `lib/preview-consent.ts`, whose own docstring calls it "the single read
 * every consent surface works from, so they can never disagree" — not from a
 * direct read of the append-only decision log. Two holes that direct read had:
 *
 *   (a) Invalidation does NOT bump `current_version`. `invalidateIfMaterialChange`
 *       sets `status='invalidated'` and clears `approved_snapshot_hash`/
 *       `approved_at` — it never touches `version`. A decision-log read keyed
 *       only on `(preview_id, version)` would still find the OLD approval row
 *       sitting at that same version and accept it, even though the anchor
 *       itself has moved on. `readApprovalState`'s `stale` flag is what
 *       actually tracks "does the live proposal still match what was
 *       approved" — that's the field this module now requires.
 *   (b) A flag-ON verified-approval requirement (`promoter.preview_verified_approval_enabled`,
 *       confirmed ON in production) means an approval with no merchant-verified
 *       provenance (`verified_via IS NULL`) is NOT a current approval — exactly
 *       the same rule `lib/preview-consent.ts#checkActivation` already enforces
 *       for publishing. Consent evidence for the RELATIONSHIP record must hold
 *       itself to the same bar as consent evidence for PUBLISHING, or the
 *       relationship record could show "permission granted" for an approval
 *       activation itself would refuse to trust.
 *
 * "A note is never evidence" still holds: nothing here reads `fit_note` /
 * `objections` / any free-text field.

 * relationship with no shop yet (`relationshipShopId === null`) can never
 * satisfy this, because there is nothing to verify the preview against, so an
 * unlinked relationship refuses consent evidence entirely rather than
 * trusting whatever preview id happens to be supplied. Without this, a
 * promoter holding two relationships (one genuinely approved, one never
 * contacted) could attach the approved preview's evidence to the OTHER
 * relationship — and per README D1, a relationship id is the opaque merchant
 * subject id every later sprint keys on.
