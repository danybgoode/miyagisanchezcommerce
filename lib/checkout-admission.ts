/**
 * lib/checkout-admission.ts — the PURE decision seam for the operating-channel
 * checkout admission read (epic 07 · owned-shop-operating-channel, decision D7).
 *
 * ── What question this answers, and why it is a DIFFERENT question ──────────────
 * `lib/checkout-market.ts` proves *published to this country marketplace*. That is
 * the right proof for a marketplace listing and the wrong one for the money path:
 * a product a shop sells on its own storefront but deliberately never listed in the
 * marketplace is refused before a cart can exist. The backend seam this module
 * reads — `GET /store/checkout-admission/:id?market=mx` — proves the one fact a
 * cart actually consumes: *this product is a member of this market's OPERATING
 * sales channel*, i.e. it is buyable.
 *
 * Admission is widened by exactly that one fact. It is NEVER widened to "any
 * product id": the same market echo must be confirmed, the same two identifier
 * fields must both equal the requested product, and the variant-ownership proof
 * below the gate in `lib/cart.ts` is untouched.
 *
 * PURE. No `fetch`, no env, no `next/*` — the Playwright `api` project drives every
 * branch here with plain objects.
 *
 * ── Three states, never two ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The backend deliberately distinguishes a REFUSAL from an OUTAGE, so this module
 * must not collapse them (`LEARNINGS.md`: known-absent and "I could not check" are
 * different facts). A 503 rendered to a buyer as "not for sale here" is a lie about
 * the catalog and sends them away from a product they could have bought a minute
 * later.
 *
 *   admitted    — proven buyable in this market.
 *   refused     — the backend answered, and the answer is no. Every product-level
 *                 refusal is one indistinguishable 404 on purpose, so this carries
 *                 no IDOR oracle: not-found, wrong-market and not-in-channel are
 *                 the same response.
 *   unproven    — a 2xx we could not verify (missing/other market echo, or the
 *                 identifiers disagree). Fails closed like its marketplace sibling.
 *   unavailable — the seam could not answer: market-level refusal or an outage.
