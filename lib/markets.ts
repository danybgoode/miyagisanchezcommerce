/**
 * markets.ts — the market registry. THE source of truth for "which countries does
 * Miyagi operate in, and what does each one mean".
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS FILE IS DUPLICATED, BYTE-FOR-BYTE, IN TWO REPOSITORIES:
 *   · apps/miyagisanchez/lib/markets.ts       (frontend)
 *   · apps/backend/src/lib/markets.ts         (backend)
 * They have no shared package and different build systems, so the contract is
 * kept honest by a GOLDEN SPEC in each repo that asserts every field of every
 * record. If one side drifts, that side's own gate goes red. Change one, change
 * both, in the same epic — and update both golden specs.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ZERO IMPORTS, ON PURPOSE. No `next`, no `@medusajs`, no env reads. That is what
 * lets the identical bytes compile in a Next.js app, a Medusa server, a Playwright
 * `api` spec and a `node:test` unit run alike — and it is why every branch below is
 * reachable from a pure unit test with no network and no database.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE: Medusa Region ids and Sales Channel ids. Those
 * are environment-resolved (they differ between local, staging and production) and
 * live in each repo's own `market-medusa` seam. Putting an id here would make the
 * registry lie the moment it is read in a different environment.
 *
 * The four concepts this file keeps SEPARATE, because collapsing any pair of them
 * is the exact defect this registry exists to prevent:
 *   market   — the operating country context (`mx`, `us`). What this file owns.
 *   locale   — presentation language. NEVER a proxy for any of the other three.
 *   Region   — Medusa's checkout currency/payment/fulfillment container.
 *   channel  — Medusa Sales Channel membership = marketplace publication truth.

 *                published into it. This is the fail-closed state.
