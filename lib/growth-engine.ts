/**
 * lib/growth-engine.ts
 *
 * Forwards events to the golden-beans Growth Engine's ingest endpoint — the Next.js
 * route at `apps/web/app/api/v1/track/route.ts` in that repo, which resolves to the
 * URL path `/api/v1/track` (verified live: `POST <deployment>/api/v1/track` returns
 * 201 against golden-beans' production deployment). Roadmap/01-growth-engine/
 * growth-engine-v1, Sprint 1 · Story 1.3. Mirrors `lib/telegram.ts`'s shape exactly:
 * fire-and-forget, never throws, never blocks the request path, silently skips when
 * unconfigured — safe to call even before GROWTH_ENGINE_URL/GROWTH_ENGINE_API_KEY
 * are set.
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   GROWTH_ENGINE_URL      — e.g. https://golden-beans-gamma.vercel.app
 *   GROWTH_ENGINE_API_KEY  — this project's per-project API key (golden-beans Story 1.1)

 * observability, and there is nothing a caller could usefully do about a failure.
 * The merchant-lifecycle emitter (lib/merchant-lifecycle-server.ts) is different —
 * it claims a once-only emission slot BEFORE sending, so it has to know whether to
 * release that slot again. A silently-swallowed failure there would burn the
 * milestone permanently: the claim row would say "already emitted" forever while
 * golden-beans never received anything.
 *
 * Returns false when unconfigured, when the request throws, and on any non-2xx —
 * a 401 from a rotated key or a 400 from a rejected context is exactly the case
 * that must not be mistaken for a delivered event.
