/**
 * lib/ssrf-fetch.ts
 *
 * SSRF DNS-pinning (epic 09 · ssrf-dns-pinning, Sprint 1). A sibling of
 * `lib/ssrf-guard.ts` — imports its `isPrivateIpv4`/`isPrivateIpv6`
 * classifiers rather than redefining them (that file stays the one place
 * those predicates live; this is NOT a third guard module).
 *
 * The problem this closes: both existing untrusted-domain callers
 * (`lib/shop-url-analyzer-fetch.ts`, `lib/shopify-mcp-client.ts`) resolve a
 * hostname, validate every returned address, then call `fetch()` — which
 * resolves the SAME hostname again, independently. Between those two
 * resolves there is a TOCTOU window: an attacker controlling DNS for the
 * target domain can flip the record between them (DNS rebinding) so the
 * address that got validated is not the address that gets dialed.
 *
 * `pinnedFetch` closes that window structurally: resolve ONCE, validate
 * every returned address, then physically dial one of the exact validated
 * IPs via a per-request undici `Agent` whose `connect.lookup` is stubbed to
 * always answer with that SAME validated set — no second, independent
 * resolve is ever possible. The original hostname is passed to `fetch()`
 * unchanged (only the dial target is pinned), so undici derives TLS
 * SNI/`servername` from it as usual — that is what preserves certificate
 * validation against the hostname the caller actually asked for, not the IP
 * we dialed.
 *
 * Why `undici` is imported directly (both `fetch` AND `Agent`), not Node's
 * global `fetch` with a duck-typed dispatcher: `undici` was, until this
 * epic, only a TRANSITIVE dependency of this package — hoisted from the
 * workspace root's node_modules (currently resolving to whatever version a
 * sibling package happens to need). Node 22 (the deployed Cloud Run image's
 * runtime, apps/miyagisanchez PR 289) has its OWN bundled `undici` backing
 * the global `fetch`, which is a different major than the hoisted one — so a
 * dispatcher built from a directly-imported `Agent` could silently mismatch
 * the dispatcher type the global `fetch` expects. Adding `undici` as a
 * DIRECT dependency here and importing `fetch`/`Agent` from it together
 * means both always come from the exact same package instance, in dev AND
 * in the `npm ci`-from-this-package's-own-lockfile Cloud Run build — the
 * deployed runtime's own bundled undici version becomes irrelevant, because
 * we never touch it.
 *
 * This deliberately BYPASSES Next.js's patched global `fetch` (and therefore
 * its Data Cache) — correct for both call sites here, which fetch an
 * arbitrary caller-supplied third-party origin on every call and must never
 * be cached.
 *
 * Kept `server-only`-free on purpose, same reason `lib/ssrf-guard.ts` is
 * (see that file's header): the Playwright `api` runner imports this module
 * directly to unit-test it, and `server-only` throws immediately when
 * imported outside a Next build — it would break the very test run meant to
 * cover this file. This was an open question in sprint-1.md ("`server-only`
 * enforcement on the new helper — raise it as a question in plan mode,
 * decide, move on"); the decision is: no, for the reason above.
 *
 * CORRECTION (cross-agent review + independent `pr-reviewer` pass,
 * 2026-07-20 — both confirmed live against real undici 8.8.0, one via a real
 * `https://www.shopify.com/` fetch through this exact shape): the first
 * version of this function called `await agent.destroy()` in a `finally`
 * immediately after `undiciFetch()` resolved. `undiciFetch()` resolves as
 * soon as HTTP HEADERS arrive — the body is still streaming — so that
 * `finally` forcibly killed the live socket while the caller was still
 * reading the body. Small payloads that fit in the same TCP flush as the
 * headers could pass by accident; anything larger (the `pr-reviewer` pass's
 * threshold ladder: 1 KB/16 KB OK, 64 KB/256 KB/1 MB failed) hit a real race
 * and threw `TypeError: terminated` on every read. `destroy()` is the
 * FORCEFUL teardown; it is still correct, and still used, on the throw path
 * below (no `Response` was ever handed to a caller there, so nothing else
 * will ever drain that connection). On the success path, the fix is to stop
 * destroying at all and instead let the per-request socket close itself the
 * moment it goes idle — see the comment inside `pinnedFetch`.
