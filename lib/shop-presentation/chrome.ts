/**
 * Living Shop — what the shop's chrome shows (epic 07, Sprint 8).
 *
 * Pure and next-free: these functions decide WHAT a header, hero, rail panel or
 * post head displays, given data the page already fetched. The components render
 * the result and hold no derivation of their own, which is what makes every
 * "…and what is withheld when the data is absent" rule testable without a
 * browser.
 *
 * The governing rule, stated once: **a panel with nothing real behind it does
 * not render.** The concept mockup is full of plausible copy — "Usually ships in
 * 2–4 days", "Next market: Roma Norte" — and inventing that for a shop that
 * never configured it would be the confident falsehood this codebase keeps
 * paying for. Every derivation below returns null rather than a placeholder.
