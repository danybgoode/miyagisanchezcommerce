 * Living Shop — one shop-presentation context per render (epic 07, Sprint 3).

 * Every section route needs the same six things: the Medusa seller, the Supabase
 * mirror row, the persisted settings, the normalized section config, what each
 * section actually has behind it, and the channel-correct base path. Six routes
 * × two channel variants deriving that independently is twelve chances to get
 * the base path or the preview guard wrong — so it is derived HERE, once.
 *
 * It also holds the two guards every public shop surface must pass: a shop that
 * does not exist, and a preview-private shop that has not consented to being
 * public. Both answer `null`, and the caller `notFound()`s.
