/**
 * Promoter Funnel v2 · Sprint 4 (US-4.1/US-4.2) — the net-remittance pure seam.
 *
 * A promoter who collected cash reports a transfer of (price − commission) instead
 * of paying by card — "settled at source": the promoter already kept their
 * commission out of the cash, so this NEVER creates an accrued commission ledger
 * row (unlike a card close, which still runs the existing accrual-then-offline-
 * settle flow via lib/promoter-commission.ts). Admin approval activates the SKU
 * via the EXISTING grant/entitlement writers — no new payment path.
 *
 * Pure + next-free (no `next/cache`, no `server-only`, no DB) — directly
 * unit-testable (e2e/promoter-transfer.spec.ts). Mirrors the shape of
 * lib/promoter-commission.ts (the settlement state machine) and
 * lib/promoter-close.ts (the S4 in-person-close string builders). The Supabase
 * CRUD lives in lib/promoter-transfers-server.ts; the metadata grant write lives
 * in lib/promoter-grant-server.ts.
 *
 * Scope: `custom_domain` | `subdomain` | `ml_sync` — the three SKUs already in the
 * close-workspace picker (`CLOSE_SKUS`). `print_ad` has its own cash-report path
 * from Sprint 3 (`/api/promoter/close/print` + the existing `/admin/print` review)
 * and isn't in the close-workspace picker until Sprint 5 — out of scope here.
