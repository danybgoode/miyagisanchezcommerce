/**
 * lib/root-language.ts — which of the two root documents a browser should read.
 *
 * The market selector exists in exactly two languages, at two static URLs: `/` in
 * Spanish and `/en` in English. This is the pure function that turns a browser's
 * stated language preferences into a choice between them, and nothing else. It
 * decides a DOCUMENT, never a market: `recommendedMarketForLocale` still owns the
 * "suggested by your browser" badge, and a visitor who reads English is not
 * thereby a United States seller — plenty of them are in Mexico.
 *
 * ── Why a second URL rather than one page that swaps text ────────────────────
 * `/` is a statically prerendered CDN asset and has to stay one: the marketplace
 * homepage once cold-started ~30 s as a per-request function, and the fix was a
 * route-group split plus client-gated chrome (`Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md`,
 * marketplace-static-shell). Reading `Accept-Language` on the server would undo
 * that, and it would not survive the edge anyway — Cloudflare fronts Cloud Run and
 * does not vary its cache key on arbitrary request headers, so one visitor's
 * language would be served to everyone behind the same cache entry.
 *
 * Two prerendered documents avoid both problems. The whole page is translated,
 * chrome included, because each root sits under its own market layout; each URL is
 * separately indexable and `hreflang`-linked; and the only thing that happens at
 * runtime is a client-side hop between two static pages.
 *
 * ── Why the region subtag is ignored here ────────────────────────────────────
 * `recommendedMarketForLocale` reads ONLY the region, because a market is a
 * country. This reads only the LANGUAGE, for the same reason inverted: `es-US` is
 * a Spanish speaker in the United States and `en-MX` is an English speaker in
 * Mexico, and both are common. Language picks the document; region picks the
 * market badge; neither stands in for the other.

 * visitor whose primary language is English but who also lists Spanish gets the
 * English document — the opposite (any Spanish anywhere ⇒ Spanish) would hand the
 * Spanish page to most bilingual users who chose otherwise in their OS settings.
 *
 * Anything that is neither Spanish nor English — the majority of the world's
 * languages — falls to Spanish, which is this platform's canonical locale
 * (AGENTS rule 5) and the language of its only operating consumer market. That is
 * a deliberate default, not a claim that the visitor reads Spanish; the switcher
 * is one click away and is rendered on both documents for exactly this reason.
