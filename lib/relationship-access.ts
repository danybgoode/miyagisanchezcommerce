/**
 * lib/relationship-access.ts
 *
 * Founding merchant activation operations · Sprint 1 — the ONE shared scope
 * check every `/api/promoter/relationship*` route calls (build contract,
 * sprint-1.md: "Put the scope check in ONE shared helper that every route
 * calls"), plus the append-only field-audit writer (Story 1.3).
 *
 * Access to a relationship is granted to FOUR actors (precedence in
 * `lib/relationship-role.ts#decideRelationshipRole` — read that doc comment
 * for the full D1 reasoning, this is only the summary):
 *   1. the caller's own `promoter_id` (their own field-captured record) — role `owner`,
 *   2. admin (`lib/admin/guard.ts#currentUserIsAdmin`) — role `admin`,
 *   3. the assigned STEWARD (`row.steward_clerk_user_id === actor.clerkUserId`,
 *      S2 C1) — role `manager`, UNLESS an explicit `partner_grants` `viewer`
 *      grant exists for them, which FLOORS them at `viewer` (S2 D1 — a
 *      deliberate write-denial outranks an implicit stewardship upgrade),
 *   4. a promoter holding an ACTIVE `partner_grants` row for the relationship's
 *      linked `shop_id` — role mirrors the grant's OWN `manager`/`viewer` role,
 *      the same grant model `lib/partner-auth.ts` already uses, reused rather
 *      than re-invented (README "what already exists").
 * Anything else is a 403 carrying NO record fields — not a 404 (which would
 * distinguish "doesn't exist" from "not yours" differently than an absent id)
 * and not a partial record. An unresolvable id (bad UUID, genuinely absent)
 * gets the exact same 403 shape as a real id the caller doesn't own, so the
 * response never confirms which case it was.
 *
 * READ access via `resolveRelationshipAccess` is NOT write access — a
 * `viewer` grant passes the scope check but every write route must also call
 * `canWriteRelationship(access.role)` (S1 cross-review A5: `lib/partner-auth.ts`
 * already denies a viewer write at the MCP layer; this closes the same hole
 * here).
 *
 * Also holds `resolveLinkableShop` (may THIS actor bind a relationship to a
 * given shop — reuses `canAnchorPreview`'s ownership rule, S1 review A3/A4)
 * and `scopedRelationshipCandidates` (the actor-scoped pool the fuzzy
 * duplicate-name scan reads from, S1 review A11/A12).
 *
 * Runtime: Node only (Supabase service-role client + Clerk admin check).
