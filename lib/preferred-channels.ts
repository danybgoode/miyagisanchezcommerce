/**
 * lib/preferred-channels.ts
 *
 * THE single source for the merchant "preferred contact channel" vocabulary —
 * the values, their es-MX labels, and the type guard.
 *
 * Created in response to fresh-reviewer finding 2 on PR #308
 * (merchant-partner-lifecycle S1). Before this file, the vocabulary existed in
 * FOUR places and had already drifted:
 *
 *   - `app/api/promoter/relationship/route.ts`        — `PREFERRED_CHANNELS` (validator)
 *   - `lib/fundadoras-application.ts`                — `PREFERRED_CHANNELS` (validator)
 *   - `app/(shell)/promotor/cerrar/RelationshipStep.tsx` — labels, `email: 'Correo'`
 *   - `lib/portfolio/resolver.ts`                    — labels, `email: 'Correo electrónico'`
 *
 * Two identical value arrays and two label maps that disagreed on one string.
 * That is the exact failure `Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md` calls *"a paraphrased
 * contract drifts permissive"* and that README D3 forbids — and the same PR that
 * introduced the fourth copy had already extracted `STAGE_LABEL` into
 * `lib/merchant-stage-labels.ts` for precisely this reason. This file gives the
 * channel vocabulary the same treatment.
 *
 * ZERO-IMPORT on purpose (no `server-only`, no `next/*`, no Clerk, no Supabase):
 * a validator on the API path, a `'use client'` form, a server component and an
 * `api` Playwright spec all have to be able to load it.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITATIVE list is the database: `merchant_relationships.preferred_channel`
 * carries a CHECK constraint over exactly these five values
 * (`supabase/migrations/20260723100000_activation_crm_s1.sql`). This file mirrors
 * that CHECK, and `PREFERRED_CHANNEL_LABEL` is typed
 * `Record<PreferredChannel, string>` so adding a sixth value without adding its
 * label fails `tsc` rather than silently rendering a merchant with no channel —
 * which is what a `Record<string, string>` allowed.

 * (PR #308, caught red by `e2e/portfolio-resolver.spec.ts`); keeping the guard
 * here means no future call site can reintroduce it.
