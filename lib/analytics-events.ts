/**
 * lib/analytics-events.ts
 *
 * The first reusable custom-event pusher into the GTM `dataLayer` bootstrapped
 * by `<SiteAnalytics>` (site-wide-analytics-gtm epic) — that epic only shipped
 * the container-load bootstrap, no event API, so this is new rather than reuse.
 * Respects the same eligibility gate (`shouldLoadAnalytics`) the container
 * itself loads under, so an event never fires on a surface where GTM was never
 * injected in the first place (white-label channels, embed widget).
 *
 * `dedupeKey`, when given, makes an event fire at most once per browser via
 * `localStorage` — for "did this happen at all" signals (a step's first
 * completion, a first share tap) where a reload/refresh would otherwise
 * re-fire it every time the now-true state re-renders.
