/**
 * lib/merchant-commerce-facts.ts
 *
 * Founding merchant activation operations · Sprint 3, Story 3.1 — the Medusa
 * commerce-fact adapter. `loadCommerceFacts(relationship)` returns the
 * state-derived subset of `lib/merchant-stage.ts`'s `StageFacts` (build
 * contract's table): `claimed`, `paymentsReady`, `threeProductsLive`,
 * `firstSale`, `retained30d`, plus the two the contract originally called
 * "CRM-sourced" — `sharedExternally` and `firstInquiry` — which turned out to
 * have real state signals after all (E1b, architect review of the S3 build):
 *
 *   - `firstInquiry` ← a `marketplace_conversations` row for the shop. A buyer
 *     opening a conversation with the shop IS the first inquiry: state-derived
 *     and complete-by-construction, exactly like the Medusa reads.
 *   - `sharedExternally` ← the shipped setup-guide "comparte" signal
 *     (`shop.metadata.settings.guide.share_done`, the same flag
 *     `app/(shell)/shop/manage/page.tsx` reads). WEAKER provenance than a
 *     Medusa read — it is the SELLER'S OWN recorded action, not a fact Medusa
 *     owns — but that is exactly why it does NOT violate D3: D3 forbids the
 *     CRM asserting commerce truth it doesn't own, and a merchant recording
 *     that they shared their own shop is a genuine fact about the merchant.
 *     Fail-closed on absence (a missing flag reads as `false`, never unknown).
 *
 * Why derive them here rather than leave them admin-only: without both, the
 * resolver's `first_sale`/`retained_30d` were UNREACHABLE (a gap at
 * `shared_externally` used to break the walk — see `resolveStage`'s header),
 * so half of Story 3.1's commerce work was inert. Deriving from state is also
 * the backfill-safety-net the sweep already relies on for the Medusa facts.
 *
 * REUSE, NOT REBUILD (build contract): the paged, fail-closed, timeout-budgeted
 * Medusa reads originated in `lib/merchant-lifecycle-sweep.ts` — six cross-
 * review rounds argued through paging correctness, fail-closed defaults and a
 * per-read timeout budget — and now live in `lib/merchant-medusa-reads.ts`
 * (extracted, unchanged, purely to break a circular import: this module needs
 * them, and the sweep now needs THIS module for its Story 3.1 relationship
 * evaluation, so the reads cannot live in either end of that cycle). This
 * module imports `countLiveProductsFromMedusa` and `listCapturedOrders` from
 * there rather than re-issuing the same fetches with subtly different
 * edge-case handling. The first-sale / retained-30-days ARITHMETIC is
 * `lib/merchant-lifecycle.ts#deriveSaleFacts` — the SAME function
 * `sweepMerchantLifecycle` itself calls, so there is only one implementation
 * of the rule to drift.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, STATE-DERIVED (build contract): every fact here is read fresh,
 * from Medusa or the shop mirror's own columns — never inferred from a webhook
 * having fired. `ok: false` on the result means AT LEAST ONE read could not be
 * completed; the caller (the cron sweep) must treat that run as INCOMPLETE
 * (retryable 5xx), never report success while quietly missing a signal. An
 * unreachable Medusa reads as "unknown", never as "zero products" or
 * "unclaimed" — `facts` simply omits whatever could not be confirmed, and
 * `resolveStage` (fail-closed by its own construction) declines to grant
 * anything from an omitted fact.
 *
 * NO MUTATION (build contract: "no adapter writes to Medusa"). Every Medusa
 * call below is a GET; every Supabase call is a `.select()`. `e2e/merchant-
 * commerce-facts.spec.ts` asserts this module's own source text contains no
 * Supabase write verb and no non-GET fetch — the population-guard, not a
 * single call site, per Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md "guard the population, not the
 * door you found".
 *
 * Runtime: Node only (Supabase service-role client + `fetch` to Medusa).
