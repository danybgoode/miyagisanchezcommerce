 * that must record a DELIVERY OUTCOME cannot distinguish "sent" from "there is no
 * push transport on this deploy". The portfolio reminder rail
 * (merchant-partner-lifecycle S2.2) needs that difference: a reminder nobody could
 * receive has to be recorded as failed, not reported as sent (cross-agent review
 * round 2, PR 310 — my first fix pre-checked the SUBSCRIPTION but not the
 * TRANSPORT, so "valid subscription + missing VAPID" still recorded a false
 * success).
