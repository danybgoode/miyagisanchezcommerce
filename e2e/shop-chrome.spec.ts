/**
 * Living Shop · Sprint 8 — the shop's own chrome.
 *
 * The governing rule these specs exist to hold: **a panel with nothing real
 * behind it does not render.** The design concept is full of plausible copy —
 * "Usually ships in 2–4 days", "Next market: Roma Norte" — and inventing that
 * for a shop that never configured it would put a promise on a merchant's
 * storefront that they never made.
 *
 * Observed red by: making `heroContent().substantial` always true (the
 * nothing-to-say case failed), by having `railOccupiesTrack` ignore its panel
 * count (the empty-column case failed), and by returning all three trust chips
 * unconditionally (the only-real-facts case failed).
