 * us-marketplace S5.2 (D17) — the signup handoff carries the intended market into the
 * FIRST seller create.
 *
 * Shop creation carried no market at all, so a merchant who signed up from `/us` got a
 * Mexican shop — pricing in pesos, publishing into the Mexican marketplace — and
 * nothing anywhere told them. The market is immutable after creation (D7), so that
 * first request is the only moment it can be set, and getting it wrong meant a shop
 * that had to be recreated.
