/**
 * POPULATION GUARD for the market catalog boundary — "guard the population, not the
 * door you found" (`Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md`), applied mechanically.
 *
 * The failure this prevents is not "one route forgot the filter". It is the shape
 * of the mistake: a previous epic guarded ONE write tool while seven siblings
 * stayed open, because the list of doors was hand-written. So nothing here is
 * hand-listed as a *discovery*. The scan walks `app/` and `lib/`, finds every file
 * that performs a marketplace catalog read against the Medusa store routes, and
 * requires each one to be CLASSIFIED. A new door added later is not "missed" — it
 * lands in no bucket and this spec goes red until somebody decides what it is.
 *
 * Three buckets, and the difference between them is the epic's whole thesis:
 *
 *   MARKET_SCOPED     — public marketplace browse. Must read through the market
 *                       seam (`lib/market-catalog.ts` → `marketCatalogFetch`).
 *   OWNERSHIP_SCOPED  — a by-id lookup on behalf of an owner, a buyer's own order,
 *                       or a payment webhook. Must NOT gain the market filter
 *                       (epic decision D4): adding it there is exactly the failure
 *                       this epic exists to prevent — an owned shop must keep
 *                       working with no marketplace membership at all.
 *   AGENT_MARKET_SCOPED — UCP/MCP public browse. Sprint 2 expired D10's temporary
 *                         deferral: these surfaces now accept `market`, must plan
 *                         through the same fail-closed seam, and verify the backend
 *                         echo before returning catalog rows.
 *   CHECKOUT_MARKET_SCOPED — a money-path admission read. It proves exact marketplace
 *                            publication BEFORE the cart write, so a guessed product id
 *                            can never use the product endpoint as a bypass.
 *
 * Source-text scanning only: no network, no DB. Comments are stripped before every
 * scan, because a negative-containment guard that fires on a doc comment explaining
 * what the module deliberately avoids punishes the documentation
 * (`LEARNINGS.md`, five separate cases in one epic).
