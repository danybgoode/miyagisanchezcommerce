/**
 * Runs on a Spanish browser — from the suite default (`playwright.config.ts`, the
 * `browser` project), NOT a pin here.
 *
 * `one-landing-per-market` (#399) gave the market selector two documents — `/` in
 * Spanish, `/en` in English — and `RootLanguageSwitch` hops between them once, on the
 * client, from `navigator.languages`. Playwright's default locale is `en-US`, so from
 * 2026-08-19 this spec landed on `/en` and failed its very first assertion against a
 * feature working exactly as designed. `admin-seleccion` broke the same way.
 *
 * The first fix pinned the locale here. That was wrong in the same way the four stale
 * `/vende` links were wrong: it fixes the instance you found and leaves the class. The
 * locale is a property of the market this whole suite tests, so it belongs to the
 * project — and once it is there, a second pin in this file is a second derivation of
 * one question that can silently disagree with the first.
 *
 * The subject here is the MARKET contract — a browser signal may recommend a market but
 * must never choose one. The hop itself is guarded on its own terms, in a real browser,
 * by e2e/root-language-hop.browser.spec.ts, which opts INTO `en-US` explicitly.
