/**
 * The storefront's seller-status vocabulary must match the backend's
 * (tenant-lifecycle-admin · D1).
 *
 * Medusa owns the seller, so `apps/backend/src/lib/seller-status.ts` is the
 * authoritative definition. These are separate repositories with separate deploys, so
 * the storefront carries a copy of the value list — and a copy that nobody checks is
 * the paraphrased contract that drifts permissive, which this codebase records as
 * having bitten it five times.
 *
 * This spec reads the backend's own source and asserts the lists agree. If the
 * backend adds a state, this goes red here rather than the admin silently rendering
 * an unknown status as a blank cell.
 *
 * ── THE CROSS-REPO CHECK IS A DEV-TIME AID, NOT THE PROTECTION ────────────────
 * It SKIPS when the sibling repo is absent, which is exactly what CI does — so on its
 * own it would be a drift guard that is green precisely where drift ships. Raised in
 * review, and correct.
 *
 * The real protection is therefore NOT this check: it is that the frontend DEGRADES
 * correctly when the backend adds a state. An unrecognised status renders as "No
 * disponible" rather than blank or "Activa", the lifecycle panel refuses to act on
 * it, and no filter silently matches it. Those properties hold without knowing what
 * the new state is, and they are asserted below — unskippably, in CI.
 *
 * The cross-repo read stays because it turns a silent drift into a loud one for
 * anyone working in the monorepo, which is where the change would actually be made.
