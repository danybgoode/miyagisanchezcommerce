/**
 * Own-shop premium presentation · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — collection-page
 * isolation. Mirrors own-shop-channel.spec.ts's pattern: the channel path
 * (`/c/[collection]`) resolves its shop ONLY from the `x-miyagi-shop-slug`
 * request header, which middleware.ts sets and STRIPS any client-supplied
 * value for on platform hosts — so a spoofed header can never leak a shop's
 * collection page onto the platform host from here. The genuine cross-host
 * (real subdomain/custom-domain) case can't be exercised against a platform
 * preview/prod baseURL at all (previews can't be reached by a foreign Host)
 * — that's local `curl -H "Host: …"` pre-merge + Daniel's real-domain smoke
 * post-merge, per this sprint's own QA plan.
 *
 * Fixture-gated tests use MS_TEST_CLAIMED_SLUG (any real, claimed shop —
 * already used elsewhere in this suite) and skip cleanly when unset.
