/**
 * The market selector's language control: the visible ES/EN switcher, and the
 * one-time automatic hop to whichever of the two documents the browser reads.
 *
 * A client island for the same reason `MarketRecommendation` is one — the server
 * render must read no request headers, or `/` stops being a static CDN asset and
 * cold-starts as a per-request function (`Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md`,
 * marketplace-static-shell). The server emits the switcher link and nothing else;
 * the language decision happens after hydration, in the browser that actually
 * holds the preference.
 *
 * ── Redirect, where the market badge only recommends ─────────────────────────
 * `MarketRecommendation` is emphatic that a browser signal may recommend a MARKET
 * but never choose one, because a market carries currency, payments and shipping —
 * consequences a visitor has to opt into. Language carries none of those. Sending
 * an English reader to the English telling of the same page decides nothing on
 * their behalf; leaving them on a Spanish page they cannot read decides quite a
 * lot. So this one navigates, and the two rules are consistent rather than in
 * tension: the page still asks which market, in a language the visitor can read.
 *
 * `replace`, not `push`, so the back button leaves the site instead of bouncing
 * off the document the visitor was just moved out of.
 *
 * ── An explicit click outranks the browser, permanently ──────────────────────
 * Clicking the switcher stores the choice, and a stored choice suppresses the
 * automatic hop on every later visit. Without that, a Mexican visitor on an en-US
 * laptop who switched to Spanish would be thrown back to English by the next page
 * load, and the control would read as broken. `localStorage` and not a cookie on
 * purpose: a cookie would be sent on every request to a page whose entire value is
 * being cacheable, and the server has no use for it.
