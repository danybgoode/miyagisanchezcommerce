/**
 * GET /api/promoter/relationship/[id] — resume a saved merchant relationship
 * record (founding-merchant-activation-ops S1.2). Powers the "resume by id
 * from localStorage" requirement in `RelationshipStep`.
 *
 * Scope: the caller's own `promoter_id`, the assigned steward (S2 C1, floored
 * to `viewer` by an explicit `partner_grants` `viewer` grant — S2 D1), an
 * active `partner_grants` row for the linked `shop_id`, or admin
 * (`resolveRelationshipAccess` — the ONE shared helper every relationship
 * route calls, whose own doc comment has the full precedence). Anything else
 * is 403 with NO record fields — not a 404 (which would distinguish "doesn't
 * exist" from "not yours" differently than an absent id) and not a partial
 * record.
 *
 * Also returns a lightweight `shop` summary when the relationship already has
 * one linked (S1 cross-review B2) — `RelationshipStep` hands this up to
 * `PromoterCloseClient` so switching to (or resuming) a relationship that
 * already has a shop REHYDRATES that shop instead of leaving the promoter
 * looking at a stale/blank one that invites creating a duplicate.
 *
 * Gated by `promoter.activation_crm_enabled` FIRST (404 when OFF).
