/**
 * Living Shop — the public Wall's next page (epic 07, Story 2.1).
 *
 * `GET /api/shop/wall?slug=<slug>&offset=<n>` — anonymous, published-and-effective
 * entries only. Drafts and not-yet-due scheduled entries are excluded by
 * `readPublicWall`, which is the SAME function the homepage renders through
 * (`lib/wall/public.ts`); a second read path here is how a draft eventually leaks
 * out of one of them.
 *
 * WHITE-LABEL BOUNDARY: on a subdomain or custom domain, middleware sets
 * `x-miyagi-shop-slug` and that header WINS over the query string. A tenant host
 * therefore serves only its own Wall — the query parameter cannot be used to read
 * another merchant's shop from inside their branded channel. The header is set by
 * middleware alone and stripped from any client that tries to inject it on a
 * platform host, so this is a real boundary and not a spoofable one.
