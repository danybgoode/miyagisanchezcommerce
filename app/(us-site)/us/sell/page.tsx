/**
 * `/us/sell` — the US merchant landing, with a URL of its own.
 *
 * ── Why this route exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This page shipped in PR 389 with no URL. It rendered ONLY as the signed-out branch
 * of `/sell` when the request happened to carry `?market=us`, which meant:
 *
 *   · `/sell` — the URL a person types, shares or prints — served the MEXICAN
 *     hero to a US merchant, in Spanish, promising SPEI and Mercado Pago;
 *   · the page could not be linked from an ad, an email or the US chrome's own
 *     "Post for free" button without hand-appending a query parameter;
 *   · its canonical was `…/sell?market=us`, so the indexable US landing was a
 *     query string hanging off a route whose default content is a different
 *     page in a different language.
 *
 * A market's landing now sits under that market's prefix, beside `/mx/vende`. The
 * URL states the market, and the market chrome — `(us-site)`'s English shell,
 * `<html lang="en-US">`, English Clerk localization — follows from the route
 * instead of from a parameter that any link could drop.
 *
 * ── English, not the visitor's stored preference ─────────────────────────────
 * `getOverriddenDictionary('en')` is literal here, and that is NOT the hardcoded
 * locale PR 389 removed from `/sell`. That one ignored a signed-in seller's own
 * explicit Spanish choice inside their portal. This is a public marketing page on
 * the US market root: it is served under English chrome by its layout, its
 * canonical and `og:locale` say `en_US`, and its copy is authored against US money
 * truth. Rendering its body in Spanish inside an English shell would be neither
 * language done properly. A Spanish-speaking merchant selling in Mexico belongs on
 * `/mx/vende`, which the root selector and the market chrome both offer.
 *
 * ── The CTA still converts on `/sign-up` ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `usSellerCtaHref` is unchanged: account creation first, with `market=us`, the
 * A/B `v` and every sanitized UTM preserved INSIDE `redirect_url` so the new
 * seller reaches the wizard with the attribution the CTA carried. The market is
 * immutable after shop creation (us-marketplace S5.2 · D17), so that parameter
 * surviving Clerk is what makes this landing produce US shops rather than Mexican
 * ones.

/**
 * Bounds the CDN TTL, and that is the whole reason it is here.
 *
 * A prerendered page in a static route group with no `revalidate` is served with
 * `s-maxage=31536000`, so Cloudflare can keep serving HTML whose build-hashed
 * `/_next/static/chunks/*` are deleted by the next Cloud Run revision — that is
 * exactly how `/` shipped an unstyled homepage on 2026-08-06. This page reads
 * `searchParams` (UTM, the A/B `v`) so it renders per request anyway; the export
 * is what keeps the edge from pinning a stale document if that ever changes.
 * `e2e/market-route-population.spec.ts` guards the whole `*-site` population, and
 * it is what caught this file.
