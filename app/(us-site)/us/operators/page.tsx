/**
 * Operator recruiting lives at `/us/operators`, NOT at `/us`.
 *
 * It used to be a flag gate on `/us` itself, sharing that URL with a legacy
 * "private pilot" page. The US marketplace epic opened `/us` as a real
 * marketplace home and that legacy page became false — the marketplace IS open.
 * Recruiting is a separate product with a separate audience, so it moved to its
 * own route rather than contending for the market root: flipping the recruiting
 * flag must never close the marketplace.
 *
 * The page renders through the shared `SellerAcquisitionPage` shell, the same one
 * `/vende/promotor` uses — this is the same field-operator program, told to a US
 * audience in English, so it should look and read like its Mexican sibling rather
 * than like the bespoke editorial layout it carried before.
